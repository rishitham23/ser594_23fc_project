Keywords: Fake News, Classification, Text Classification

Description: 
This data science project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for the classification of news articles as either fake or legitimate. The project will utilize a dataset of news articles and associated metadata to train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms for accurate fake news detection. The project's focus is to leverage data science techniques to tackle the growing issue of misinformation in media.

Intellectual Merit: 
The intellectual merit of this project lies in its potential to contribute new insights and practical solutions to the problem of fake news detection. By developing and evaluating machine learning models on real-world data, this project has the potential to advance our understanding of the effectiveness of data-driven approaches in combating the spread of misinformation.

Data Sourcing: 
Data will be sourced from a combination of reputable news outlets, fact-checking organizations, and publicly available datasets containing news articles. The dataset will include articles published in 2023 to ensure relevance.I will also explore the possibility of web scraping to collect additional data if necessary, adhering to ethical and legal guidelines.
